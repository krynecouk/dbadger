## Description

This task is about implementing of web based database browser (similar to desktop application DBeaver) with basic
functionality and for single database vendor only. Browser should be able to register multiple database connections and
browse their data and structure. The result should be RESTful service with its own database. This task should be
implemented in Java. Database for persistence of data is your choice. If no other information about technology
specified, you can use whatever technologies/frameworks you like. Non-functional requirements:

- Use spring-boot (Spring MVC)
- Use git and send us your repository with a solution

## How to run

1. go to `/env` and run`docker-compose up` (PostgreSQL and SwaggerUI)
2. go to `/be` and run `./gradlew bootRun` (DBadger)
3. go to `localhost:80`

## TODO

- dockerize app;
- add tests (e.g., row mappers, exception handling, datasource invalidation cron job...)
- add better logging;
- add much better exception handling;
- add better configuration options;
- connection(id INT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY) - not working, id mandatory;
- add statistics endpoint;
